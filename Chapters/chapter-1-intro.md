### Slide 2: Introduction to Git Flow
- **Definition:** Git Flow is a branching model for Git that encourages parallel development and collaboration.
- **Purpose:** Simplifies the management of feature development, hotfixes, and releases.

### Slide 3: Git Flow Branches Overview
- **Master:** Contains production-ready code.
- **Develop:** Integrates features for the next release.
- **Feature:** Used to develop new features.
- **Release:** Prepares for a new production release.
- **Hotfix:** Fixes for production bugs.

### Slide 4: Semantic Versioning
- **Definition:** A versioning scheme using three numbers: Major.Minor.Patch (e.g., 1.2.3).
- **Major:** Breaking changes.
- **Minor:** New features, but backwards compatible.
- **Patch:** Bug fixes and minor changes.

### Slide 5: Git Flow Process (Before Release Branch)
1. **Feature Development:** 
   - Branch from `feature-release` (e.g., `feature-release/1.0`).
   - Develop features on `feature` branches (e.g., `feature/feature-name`).
2. **Merging:** 
   - Merge `feature` branches into `feature-release`.
   - Test and validate.
   - Merge `feature-release` into `develop`.
3. **Release to Production:** 
   - Merge `develop` into `master`.
   - Tag `master` with the version number.
   - CI/CD pipeline handles versioning and deployment.

### Slide 6: Example Git Flow (Before Release Branch)
- Diagram showing branches and merge flow.
  - `feature-release/1.0` -> `feature/feature-A`, `feature/feature-B`.
  - `feature/feature-A` -> `feature-release/1.0` -> `develop` -> `master`.

### Slide 7: Git Flow Process (After Release Branch)
1. **Feature Development:** 
   - Same as before: Branch from `feature-release`.
2. **Release Preparation:** 
   - Create `release` branch (e.g., `release/1.0`).
   - Merge `feature-release` into `release`.
   - Final testing on `release` branch.
3. **Merging:** 
   - Merge `release` into `develop`.
   - Merge `develop` into `master`.
   - Tag `master` with the version number.

### Slide 8: Example Git Flow (After Release Branch)
- Diagram showing branches and merge flow.
  - `feature-release/1.0` -> `feature/feature-A`, `feature/feature-B`.
  - `feature/feature-A` -> `feature-release/1.0` -> `release/1.0` -> `develop` -> `master`.

### Slide 9: Handling Hotfixes
- **Hotfix Creation:** Branch from `master` (e.g., `hotfix/1.0.1`).
- **Merging Hotfixes:** 
   - Merge `hotfix` back into `master`.
   - Merge `hotfix` into `develop`.

### Slide 10: Best Practices for Git Flow
- **Consistent Naming:** Follow naming conventions for branches.
- **Regular Merges:** Frequently merge `develop` and `feature-release` to avoid large merge conflicts.
- **Code Reviews:** Implement code reviews before merging.
- **Automated Testing:** Ensure all tests pass before merging to `develop` or `master`.

### Slide 11: Benefits of Using Git Flow
- **Organized Workflow:** Clear structure for managing changes.
- **Parallel Development:** Enables multiple teams to work simultaneously.
- **Controlled Releases:** Simplifies the release process and minimizes risks.

### Slide 12: Tools and Automation
- **CI/CD Pipelines:** Automate testing and deployment.
- **Semantic Versioning Tools:** Automatically update version numbers.
- **Git Hooks:** Enforce rules and automate checks at different stages.

### Slide 13: Adapting Git Flow to Our Needs
- **Custom Branches:** `feature-release` for intermediate feature integration.
- **Monthly Releases:** Regular cadence with `release` branches.
- **Quick Fixes:** Direct merges to `develop` or `release` branches as needed.

### Slide 14: Transitioning to the New Workflow
- **Training:** Ensure the team understands the new `release` branch workflow.
- **Documentation:** Update internal guides and documentation.
- **Feedback Loop:** Continuously gather feedback and make improvements.

### Slide 15: Q&A
- **Open Floor:** Address any questions or concerns from the team.
