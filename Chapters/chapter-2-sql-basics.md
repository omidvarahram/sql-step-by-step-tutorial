Hi [Colleague's Name],

I wanted to share my appreciation for the role you've played in our team, particularly concerning the NAB-X | X-Ceptional project.

- **Relationship to the role:** While not directly reporting to you, your leadership has been instrumental in guiding the team. Your clear communication and ability to navigate challenging situations at the organizational level have been evident and appreciated.

- **Impactful contributions:** Your proactive approach in identifying and addressing complex challenges has significantly improved our daily operations. Your competence in dissecting complex solutions into manageable tasks has not only enhanced productivity but also fostered a better understanding of technical requirements among the team members.

- **Contribution to team success:** Your exceptional problem-solving skills and the ability to translate complex solutions into technical language have been a cornerstone of our team's success. The culture within the team has notably improved due to your contributions, cultivating a positive and efficient working environment.

- **Suggestions for the future:** It's challenging to suggest improvements when your performance is already outstanding. However, if there's an area for potential growth, it might be beneficial to share your strategic planning techniques more widely within the team. This could empower others to develop similar skills, further enhancing our team's capability.

Your role has been more than that of a team lead; it has been that of a mentor and a catalyst for change. Your contributions have laid a solid foundation for our team's culture and success.

Thank you for your dedication and hard work.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
