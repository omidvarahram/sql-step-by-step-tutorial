In the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file of this repository, we aim to provide a comprehensive guide for both new members and external teams looking to contribute to our project. The intention of this document is to establish clear and consistent guidelines for contributions, ensuring that all collaborators are aligned with the project's goals, standards, and practices. This file serves as a vital reference, detailing the processes for submitting changes, reporting issues, and proposing new features. It also outlines our code of conduct, emphasizing respect, inclusivity, and collaboration. By following these guidelines, contributors can effectively and efficiently participate in the development of the project, fostering a positive and productive community environment.
## Branching Strategy, Pull Requests, and Forking

### Branching Strategy
Our project employs a specific branching strategy to streamline the development and release process. Contributors should create branches with a `feature-release` prefix, branching off from the `develop` branch. This is the primary branch for integrating new features or fixes. For detailed information on our branching strategy, please refer to our [Branching Strategy Documentation](#placeholder-link).

### Creating Feature and Fix Branches
- **Feature Branches**: When developing new features, create a branch with the prefix `feature` from the `feature-release` branch.
- **Fix Branches**: For bug fixes, use the prefix `fix` for branches, also branching from `feature-release`.

### Pull Requests (PRs)
1. **Creating PRs**: Once development on a `feature` or `fix` branch is complete, create a PR against the `feature-release` branch.
2. **Review and Approval**: Each PR requires a minimum of two approvals, including at least one from the code owners, to be merged into the `feature-release` branch.
3. **Merging to `feature-release`**: Merging a PR into the `feature-release` branch generates an alpha version of the application.
4. **PR from `feature-release` to `develop`**: After merging into `feature-release`, create another PR to merge the changes into the `develop` branch. Merging into `develop` creates a beta version of the application.
5. **Final PR to `master`**: To release a production version, create a PR from `develop` to `master`. This step signifies a new release of the application.

### Forking and Automated Pipeline Handling
External teams are encouraged to fork the repository for their development purposes. Our automated pipelines are designed to seamlessly identify PRs originating from forked repositories. These pipelines will automatically handle the process of raising issues and managing merges, given the proper approvals are in place. This integration ensures a smooth workflow and maintains the integrity and continuity of the project development, even with contributions from various external sources.

### Approval Process
All merging steps in this workflow require a minimum of two approvals, with at least one approval from a code owner, to ensure quality and adherence to project standards.

### Release Process Overview

The release process in our project is a structured and automated sequence, designed to ensure a smooth transition of code from development to production. This process involves the creation of alpha and beta versions, leading up to a final release. We adhere to semantic versioning principles, and the entire process is fully automated to maintain consistency and efficiency.

#### Alpha Version Creation
- **Branching for Alpha**: Developers create feature or fix branches with appropriate prefixes (`feature` or `fix`) from the `feature-release` branch.
- **Merging to `feature-release`**: Upon completion, these branches are merged into the `feature-release` branch through a pull request. This merge generates an alpha version of the application.
- **Automated Versioning**: Our automated systems automatically assign a semantic version number to this alpha release, reflecting the nature and extent of changes made.

#### Beta Version Creation
- **PR to `develop`**: After the alpha version is stable, a pull request is created to merge the `feature-release` branch into the `develop` branch.
- **Merging and Beta Version**: Merging into the `develop` branch results in the creation of a beta version. This version is meant for broader testing and final adjustments before the production release.
- **Automated Beta Versioning**: Similar to the alpha version, the beta version is automatically assigned a semantic version number, indicating its stage in the release process.

#### Final Release
- **PR from `develop` to `master`**: The final step is a pull request from the `develop` branch to the `master` branch. This PR signifies the readiness of the code for production.
- **Production Release**: Merging this PR into the `master` branch triggers the release of the new production version of the application.
- **Automated Semantic Versioning**: The release to the `master` branch is automatically assigned a final semantic version number, indicating its official release status.

#### Summary
Throughout this process, each step is carefully automated to align with semantic versioning. This automation ensures that version numbers accurately reflect the changes in each release, be it an alpha, beta, or final production release. The emphasis on automation not only streamlines the release process but also minimizes human error, ensuring a reliable and consistent release workflow.
