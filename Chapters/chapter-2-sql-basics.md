
DexGuard (for Android) and iXGuard (for iOS), both developed by Guardsquare, offer flexibility in applying obfuscation to specific parts of your application:

### Selective Obfuscation

- **DexGuard & iXGuard**: Both tools allow you to specify which parts of your application you want to obfuscate. You can choose to obfuscate only certain classes, methods, or fields. This is useful if you want to protect only the most sensitive parts of your code, such as algorithms or key management systems.

### Impact on Binary File

- **Single Binary**: Even when obfuscating only specific parts of the code, the output remains a single binary file. The obfuscated code is integrated into the overall compiled application.
- **File Size and Performance**: The impact of obfuscation on the binary file size and performance can vary. Typically, obfuscation can increase the file size slightly due to the added complexity, but the actual impact depends on the extent and type of obfuscation used. However, modern obfuscation tools are designed to minimize any negative impact on performance.

### Considerations

- **Balance between Security and Usability**: It's essential to find a balance between security and usability. Over-obfuscation can make the code difficult to manage and debug. It's often recommended to focus obfuscation on the most critical parts of the codebase.
- **Testing**: After applying obfuscation, thorough testing is necessary to ensure that the application still functions as expected and that the obfuscation hasn't introduced any unintended side effects.

For the most accurate and detailed information, including specific configuration options and best practices, it's recommended to refer directly to the official documentation of DexGuard and iXGuard. Unfortunately, I can't browse their documentation directly, but you can find it on the Guardsquare website or by contacting their support team for specific queries.
