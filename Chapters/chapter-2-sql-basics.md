From the images you've shared, it seems that your Jest and Babel configurations are mostly correct. However, there might be a few reasons why you're still getting the error.

One potential issue I can see from your Jest configuration is that you are using a `preset` for `react-native`, but your environment is set to `node`. The `react-native` preset might already include configurations that are suitable for React Native environments, which may conflict with Node settings.

Hereâ€™s a revised version of your `jest.config.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  preset: 'react-native',
  moduleFileExtensions: ['ts', 'tsx', 'js', 'jsx', 'json', 'node'],
  transform: {
    '^.+\\.(js|jsx|ts|tsx)$': 'babel-jest',
  },
  transformIgnorePatterns: [
    'node_modules/(?!(react-native|my-project|react-native-button)/)',
  ],
  moduleNameMapper: {
    '\\.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif|svg|webp)$': '<rootDir>/__mocks__/fileMock.js',
    '\\.(css|less)$': 'identity-obj-proxy',
  },
  setupFilesAfterEnv: [
    '@testing-library/jest-native/extend-expect',
    './setupTests.tsx',
  ],
  collectCoverage: true,
  collectCoverageFrom: [
    'src/**/*.{ts,tsx}',
    '!src/**/*.d.ts',
  ],
  coverageThreshold: {
    global: {
      branches: 5,
      functions: 5,
      lines: 5,
      statements: 5,
    },
  },
};
```

And your `babel.config.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  presets: [
    'module:metro-react-native-babel-preset',
    ['@babel/preset-env', { targets: { node: 'current' } }],
    '@babel/preset-react',
    '@babel/preset-typescript',
  ],
  plugins: [
    'react-native-reanimated/plugin',
    '@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties',
    '@babel/plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread',
  ],
};
```

Here are some additional steps you can try:

1. **Check for a higher-level `babel.config.js`**: Sometimes, a Babel configuration at a higher level in your project directory can interfere with your settings.

2. **Review the `transformIgnorePatterns`**: The pattern should exclude the node_modules you want to transform. The one in your config seems to be quite specific and might exclude necessary transformations. You may want to simplify it temporarily to troubleshoot:

   ```javascript
   transformIgnorePatterns: [
     'node_modules/(?!(react-native|react-native-button|YOUR_LIBRARY_TO_BE_TRANSFORMED)/)',
   ],
   ```

   Replace `YOUR_LIBRARY_TO_BE_TRANSFORMED` with the actual libraries you need to transform.

3. **Clear Jest Cache**: Sometimes Jest's cache can cause issues. Clear it with `jest --clearCache`.

4. **Install and Use `react-native` Jest Preset**: If not already installed, make sure you have the `react-native` Jest preset installed, as your Jest config is using it.

5. **Run Jest with `--verbose` flag**: This will give you more detailed output, which could help in debugging the issue.

Try these modifications and see if they resolve your issue. If the problem persists, it might be related to something else in your project setup that's not visible in the shared configuration files.
