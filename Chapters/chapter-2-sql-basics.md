#### Microfrontend Methods

##### Module Federation with Webpack
**Overview**:
- Module Federation is a feature of Webpack 5 that enables the sharing of modules between separate builds and facilitates microfrontend architecture.
- Allows dynamic loading of MiniApps at runtime without the need for a full application rebuild.

**Integration Details**:
- **Exposing Modules**: Each MiniApp exposes its main entry point and shared dependencies.
- **Consuming Modules**: The Shell application consumes these exposed modules and integrates them dynamically.
- **Configuration**: Webpack configuration files for both Shell and MiniApps are set up to handle module federation.

**Configuration Example**:
**Shell Application (React) Webpack Configuration**:
```javascript
const ModuleFederationPlugin = require('webpack/lib/container/ModuleFederationPlugin');

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    new ModuleFederationPlugin({
      name: 'shell',
      remotes: {
        vueApp: 'vueApp@http://localhost:3001/remoteEntry.js',
        angularApp: 'angularApp@http://localhost:3002/remoteEntry.js',
      },
      shared: { /* shared dependencies */ }
    })
  ]
};
```

**Vue MiniApp Webpack Configuration**:
```javascript
const ModuleFederationPlugin = require('webpack/lib/container/ModuleFederationPlugin');

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    new ModuleFederationPlugin({
      name: 'vueApp',
      filename: 'remoteEntry.js',
      exposes: {
        './VueComponent': './src/main.js',
      },
      shared: { /* shared dependencies */ }
    })
  ]
};
```

##### Web Components
**Overview**:
- Web Components allow the creation of reusable custom elements encapsulated in their own HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**Integration Details**:
- **Custom Elements**: MiniApps are developed as custom elements that can be used in any HTML page.
- **Shadow DOM**: Encapsulates the internal DOM structure and styles to prevent conflicts.
- **Registration**: Custom elements are registered using the customElements.define API.

**Example**:
```javascript
class MyWebComponent extends HTMLElement {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.attachShadow({ mode: 'open' });
    this.shadowRoot.innerHTML = `<style>/* styles here */</style><div>Content here</div>`;
  }
}

customElements.define('my-web-component', MyWebComponent);
```

##### iFrames
**Overview**:
- iFrames allow embedding of an entire HTML document within another HTML document, providing isolation and security.

**Integration Details**:
- **Embedding**: MiniApps are hosted on separate URLs and embedded within the Shell application using iFrame elements.
- **Communication**: PostMessage API is used for secure communication between the Shell and MiniApps.

**Example**:
```html
<iframe src="http://localhost:3003" width="100%" height="500px"></iframe>
```

**Communication Example**:
```javascript
// Sending a message from MiniApp
window.parent.postMessage('Hello from MiniApp', '*');

// Receiving a message in Shell
window.addEventListener('message', (event) => {
  if (event.origin === 'http://localhost:3003') {
    console.log(event.data);
  }
});
```

**Example Implementation**
```javascript
const AuthContext = React.createContext();
const NavContext = React.createContext();
const UserContext = React.createContext();

const actions = {
  getAuthData: () => {
    // Retrieve auth data
  },
  updateUserContext: (data) => {
    // Update user context
  }
};

// Converting actions to events
Object.keys(actions).forEach(action => {
  document.addEventListener(action, (event) => {
    actions[action](event.detail);
  });
});
```

#### Runtime Initialization
**Tasks Executed at Runtime**

- **Support**: Method to check if the provided authentication configuration is supported.

**Example Implementation**
```javascript
class AuthStrategy {
  constructor(config) {
    this.config = config;
  }

  authenticate() {
    if (this.support()) {
      // Perform authentication
    } else {
      throw new Error('Unsupported authentication method');
    }
  }

  support() {
    // Check if the provided config is supported
    return this.config.type === 'OAuth' || this.config.type === 'SAML';
  }
}

// Usage
const authConfig = { type: 'OAuth', ...otherConfig };
const authStrategy = new AuthStrategy(authConfig);
authStrategy.authenticate();
```

The Navigation Service provides the necessary data for the Shell application to render the navigation based on the nav-config.json file.

**Functionality**
- **Load Navigation Data**: Fetch and parse the nav-config.json file.
- **Provide Navigation Methods**: Offer methods to retrieve routes, load components, and handle navigation events.

**Example Implementation**
```javascript
class NavigationService {
  constructor(configPath) {
    this.configPath = configPath;
    this.navigationData = [];
  }

  async loadNavigationData() {
    const response = await fetch(this.configPath);
    const config = await response.json();
    this.navigationData = config.navigation;
  }

  getRoutes() {
    return this.navigationData.map(route => ({
      path: route.path,
      component: this.loadComponent(route)
    }));
  }

  loadComponent(route) {
    if (route.method === 'moduleFederation') {
      return async () => {
        await __webpack_init_sharing__('default');
        const container = await window[route.component].get(route.url);
        await container.init(__webpack_share_scopes__.default);
        const factory = await container.get(route.component);
        return factory();
      };
    } else if (route.method === 'webComponent') {
      return () => customElements.get(route.component);
    } else if (route.method === 'iframe') {
      return () => <iframe src={route.url} />;
    }
  }
}

// Usage
const navigationService = new NavigationService('/path/to/nav-config.json');
navigationService.loadNavigationData().then(() => {
  const routes = navigationService.getRoutes();
  console.log(routes);
});
```

### 7. MiniApp Loading

#### Overview
The MiniApp Loading process is a crucial part of the x-framework-react, as it determines how different MiniApps are integrated into the Shell application. This section describes the different methods used to load MiniApps: module federation, web components, and iFrames. Each method has its specific use cases, benefits, and implementation details.

#### Loading Methods

##### Module Federation
**Overview**
- Module Federation is a feature of Webpack 5 that allows the sharing of modules between separate builds. It enables dynamic loading of MiniApps into the Shell application without the need for a full rebuild.

**Implementation Details**
- **Exposing Modules**: Each MiniApp exposes its main entry point and shared dependencies using Webpack's Module Federation Plugin.
- **Consuming Modules**: The Shell application consumes these exposed modules and integrates them dynamically at runtime.

**Example Configuration**
**MiniApp Webpack Configuration**:
```javascript
const ModuleFederationPlugin = require('webpack/lib/container/ModuleFederationPlugin');

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    new ModuleFederationPlugin({
      name: 'miniApp',
      filename: 'remoteEntry.js',
      exposes: {
        './Component': './src/Component'
      },
      shared: { react: { singleton: true }, 'react-dom': { singleton: true } }
    })
  ]
};
```

**Shell Application Webpack Configuration**:
```javascript
const ModuleFederationPlugin = require('webpack/lib/container/ModuleFederationPlugin');

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    new ModuleFederationPlugin({
      name: 'shell',
      remotes: {
        miniApp: 'miniApp@http://localhost:3001/remoteEntry.js'
      },
      shared: { react: { singleton: true }, 'react-dom': { singleton: true } }
    })
  ]
};
```

**Dynamic Import in Shell Application**:
```javascript
import React, { Suspense, lazy } from 'react';

const MiniAppComponent = lazy(() => import('miniApp/Component'));

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Shell Application</h1>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading MiniApp...</div>}>
        <MiniAppComponent />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

##### Web Components
**Overview**
- Web Components allow for the creation of reusable custom elements encapsulated in their own HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making them framework-agnostic and easy to integrate.

**Implementation Details**
- **Creating Custom Elements**: Each MiniApp is developed as a custom element.
- **Registering Elements**: Custom elements are registered using the customElements.define API.

**Example Implementation**:
```javascript
// MiniApp Web Component
class MiniAppComponent extends HTMLElement {
  constructor() {
    super();
    const shadow = this.attachShadow({ mode: 'open' });
    shadow.innerHTML = `<style>/* styles here */</style><div>MiniApp Content</div>`;
  }
}

customElements.define('mini-app-component', MiniAppComponent);
```

**Using Web Component in Shell Application**:
```javascript
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Shell Application</h1>
      <mini-app-component></mini-app-component>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

##### iFrames
**Overview**
- iFrames allow embedding an entire HTML document within another HTML document, providing isolation and security.

**Implementation Details**
- **Embedding MiniApps**: MiniApps are hosted on separate URLs and embedded within the Shell application using iFrame elements.
- **Communication**: The PostMessage API is used for secure communication between the Shell and MiniApps.

**Example Usage**:
```html
<iframe src="http://localhost:3002" width="100%" height="500px"></iframe>
```

**Communication Example**:
```javascript
// Sending a message from MiniApp
window.parent.postMessage('Hello from MiniApp', '*');

// Receiving a message in Shell
window.addEventListener('message', (event) => {
  if (event.origin === 'http://localhost:3002') {
    console.log(event.data);
  }
});
```
